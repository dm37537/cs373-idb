              Do you want to help developers monetize and advertise their apps across mobile phones and tablets?

              We are looking for a software development engineer to build back-end services for the next generation Mobile Advertising Demand platform. This platform will extend frictionless advertising capabilities for digital and physical goods enabling our customers promote goods through a seamless experience. You will drive innovation on a number of technologies across campaign and image optimization techniques. You will work on a distributed system leveraging AWS that would manage campaigns to meet service level goals. This is a unique opportunity to learn about the advertising supply/demand dynamics and build software solutions to manage delivery of advertising budgets. You will work with partner teams that display ads across all mobile platforms e.g. iOS, Android, HTML5 as well as other advertising exchanges. As a key team member, you will own major deliverables through all aspects of the development cycle: scoping, design, implementation, testing on solutions delivered.
